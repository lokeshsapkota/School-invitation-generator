# School Invitation Generator

This Python script generates invitation documents for schools using a template (.docx) file. It fills in placeholders in the template with school-specific details such as name, address, and date.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install python-docx`.
3. Place your template document (`template.docx`) in the same directory as the script.
4. Provide school details in the `details.txt` file, with each line containing information in the format `school_name, school_address`.
5. Run the script using `python school_invitation_generator.py`.
